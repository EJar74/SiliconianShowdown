# SiliconianShowdown

Vor: Siliconian Showdown is a fan-made battle simulator based on the now-defunct MMO game "Nanovor", developed by Smith & Tinker Co.
It in no way claims ownership of any intellectual property or original ideas created and owned by Smith & Tinker. It is not for-profit,
and is free to use by anyone. The purpose of the simulator is to bridge the gap between theorycrafting strategies and testing them
in real-world scenarios.

To run the program, simply download the zipped file, and make sure to set your computer's permissions to allow the executable to be opened.
From there, simply type in a screenname of your choosing, select any number of players, wait to find a match, and voila! You are now 
inside of a match in the simulator, and can experiment with many different swarms and Nanovor.
